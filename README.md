# TYPO3 GitPod Review Addon

The TYPO3 addon aims to allow contributors to review
patches in a quick and easy way using GitPod.

So no local setup is required. Just got to review.typo3.org
and select a patch. Then click the shiny TYPO3 icon of your
browsers action toolbar. Chooses your setting and hit "Open in GitPod".
This will spin up an instance of TYPO3 with the selected patch
applied and ready for testing.
